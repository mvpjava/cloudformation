DCV CloudFormation template Used to create EC2 with DCV Remote Desktop for a Centos Stream 9 AMI.

Can even be created without need to use instance type with GPU (t3.medium is enough)

Tested with template parameters as specified in screen shot CentOS9-DCV-CFN-InputParamValues-ScreenShot.png

Tested with browser at https:$PUBLIC_IP:8443

and also with Windows Client from site: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/userguide/client-windows.html
which I used the "To install the Windows client using an unattended installation". It works great and more responsive than browser client.

Despite GitHub docs for DCV Centos Install, the default Centos user is ec2-user and not cloud-user. I had to create the ec2-user password in the Centos O.S
via command "sudo passwd ec2-user" then, you can use the DCV cline tto log in.

What is anoying is that if you want to use Amazon Linux 2 still, you cannot install some very common developer tools like VS Code since some dependancies
like glibc libs are stuck at 2.26 and VS Code needs 2.28. The AWS Team will not update it so, your stuck. You might think, just use Amazon Linus 2023
but they dont support graphic front ends. Thus, no DCV support. Now you have to go with a another Linux distro which can be a really big effort at scale.
This is why I settled on Centos Stream 9 which, I subscribed on AWS Marketplace for. It is free. You can see this in the screen shot.
